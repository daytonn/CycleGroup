SublimeToggleGroup
==================

This plugin allows you to toggle the currently focused group and easily swap open files between groups without having to use the target group number.

For example, if you have the screen split into 2 groups and you are focused on the left group (1) and you wish to focus the right group (2), you simply hit the toggle command `super+\` and the focus will toggle to the currently unfocused group.

Toggling open files between groups work in the same way. To move a file from one group to another, simply hold add shift to the previous command: `super+shift+\`.

Now you no longer have to think about where you want to focus or move a file, you simply put it on the opposite group.
